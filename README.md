# Ruby Exercises

This repository contains various beginner-level Ruby exercises done as part of my training at [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/).

## What‚Äôs Inside

Each file is a small exercise to practice Ruby basics:

- Variables and data types
- `puts` vs `print`
- User input with `gets.chomp`
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, `times`, `each`, `for`, etc.
- Arrays and loops
- String interpolation and `.to_i` conversion
- Fun with pyramids üè∞
